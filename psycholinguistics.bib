	abstract = "Previous research suggests that the processing of
                  agreement is affected by the distance between the
                  agreeing elements. However, the unique contribution
                  of structural distance (number of intervening
                  syntactic phrases) to the processing of agreement
                  remains an open question, since previous
                  investigations do not tease apart structural and
                  linear distance (number of intervening words). We
                  used event-related potentials (ERPs) to examine the
                  extent to which structural distance impacts the
                  processing of Spanish number and gender
                  agreement. Violations were realized both within the
                  phrase and across the phrase. Across both levels of
                  structural distance, linear distance was kept
                  constant, as was the syntactic category of the
                  agreeing elements. Number and gender agreement
                  violations elicited a robust \{P600\} between 400
                  and 900ms, a component associated with
                  morphosyntactic processing. No amplitude differences
                  were observed between number and gender violations,
                  suggesting that the two features are processed
                  similarly at the brain level. Within-phrase
                  agreement yielded more positive waveforms than
                  across-phrase agreement, both for agreement
                  violations and for grammatical sentences (no
                  agreement by distance interaction). These effects
                  can be interpreted as evidence that structural
                  distance impacts the establishment of agreement
                  overall, consistent with sentence processing models
                  which predict that hierarchical structure impacts
                  the processing of syntactic dependencies. However,
                  due to the lack of an agreement by distance
                  interaction, the possibility cannot be ruled out
                  that these effects are driven by differences in
                  syntactic predictability between the within-phrase
                  and across-phrase configurations, notably the fact
                  that the syntactic category of the critical word was
                  more predictable in the within-phrase conditions. "

	abstract = {This study explored lexical-syntactic information – syntactic
                  information that is stored in the lexicon – and its
                  relation to syntactic and lexical impairments in
                  aphasia. We focused on two types of
                  lexical-syntactic information: predicate argument
                  structure (PAS) of verbs (the number and types of
                  arguments the verb selects) and grammatical gender
                  of nouns. The participants were 17 Hebrew-speaking
                  individuals with aphasia who had a syntactic deficit
                  (agrammatism) or a lexical retrieval deficit
                  (anomia) located at the semantic lexicon, the
                  phonological output lexicon, or the phonological
                  output buffer. After testing the participants’
                  syntactic and lexical retrieval abilities and
                  establishing the functional loci of their deficits,
                  we assessed their \{PAS\} and grammatical gender
                  knowledge. This assessment included sentence
                  completion, sentence production, sentence
                  repetition, and grammaticality judgment tasks. The
                  participants’ performance on these tests yielded
                  several important dissociations. Three agrammatic
                  participants had impaired syntax but unimpaired
                  \{PAS\} knowledge. Three agrammatic participants had
                  impaired syntax but unimpaired grammatical gender
                  knowledge. This indicates that lexical-syntactic
                  information is represented separately from syntax,
                  and can be spared even when syntax at the sentence
                  level, such as embedding and movement are
                  impaired. All 5 individuals with phonological output
                  buffer impairment and all 3 individuals with
                  phonological output lexicon impairment had preserved
                  lexical-syntactic knowledge. These selective
                  impairments indicate that lexical-syntactic
                  information is represented at a lexical stage prior
                  to the phonological lexicon and the phonological
                  buffer. Three participants with impaired \{PAS\}
                  (aPASia) and impaired grammatical gender who showed
                  intact lexical-semantic knowledge indicate that the
                  lexical-syntactic information is represented
                  separately from the semantic lexicon. This led us to
                  conclude that lexical-syntactic information is
                  stored in a separate syntactic lexicon. A double
                  dissociation between \{PAS\} and grammatical gender
                  impairments indicated that different types of
                  lexical-syntactic information are represented
                  separately in this syntactic lexicon.}

                  unlikely that each category is represented in a
                  distinct brain area. A more efficient scheme would
                  be to represent categories as locations in a
                  continuous semantic space mapped smoothly across the
                  cortical surface. To search for such a space, we
                  used fMRI to measure human brain activity evoked by
                  natural movies. We then used voxelwise models to
                  examine the cortical representation of 1,705 object
                  and action categories. The first few dimensions of
                  the underlying semantic space were recovered from
                  the fit models by principal components
                  analysis. Projection of the recovered semantic space
                  onto cortical flat maps shows that semantic
                  selectivity is organized into smooth gradients that
                  cover much of visual and nonvisual
                  cortex. Furthermore, both the recovered semantic
                  space and the cortical organization of the space are

                  a core aspect of sentence structure. Research on
                  complex sentences with displaced elements has
                  concluded that resolving long-distance dependencies
                  can tax working memory. Here we examine a simpler
                  relationship—morphological agreement between the
                  elements of a noun phrase—across a gradient of
                  distance. Participants read sentences with
                  violations of gender agreement among Spanish nouns,
                  determiners and adjectives. For those explicitly
                  assigned the task of detecting errors, accuracy was
                  uniformly high across the four levels of distance
                  between (dis)agreeing words. A second group
                  performed a comprehension task as \{ERPs\} were
                  recorded. Gender agreement errors elicited a left
                  anterior negativity (LAN) regardless of the distance
                  between (dis)agreeing words, indicating that the
                  errors were detected. In contrast, a temporally
                  later component of the \{ERP\} (P600) showed
                  decreasing amplitudes as the number of words between
                  (dis)agreeing elements increased. Smaller \{P600\}
                  responses were also associated with slower responses
                  to the comprehension questions. Given other work
                  suggesting that the \{P600\} indexes attempted
                  repair of a problematic sentence structure, the
                  results suggest that the participants became
                  increasingly unwilling to re-visit their initial
                  parse of a sentence as the required effort
                  increased, despite having noted an error. The
                  results are discussed within the context of studies
                  showing that readers often compute inadequate
                  structural representations of sentences. We suggest
                  that \{P600\} amplitude may reflect the costs versus
                  benefits of sentence re-analysis, determined by a
                  combination of sentence structure, task
                  requirements, and the degree to which sentence
                  meaning hinges on a correct structural analysis. "

                  magnetoencephalography (MEG) and machine learning
                  techniques to investigate the flow of perceptual and
                  semantic information decodable from neural activity
                  in the half second during which the brain
                  comprehends the meaning of a concrete
                  noun. Important information about the cortical
                  location of neural activity related to the
                  representation of nouns in the human brain has been
                  revealed by past studies using fMRI. However, the
                  temporal sequence of processing from sensory input
                  to concept comprehension remains unclear, in part
                  because of the poor time resolution provided by
                  fMRI. In this study, subjects answered 20 questions
                  (e.g. is it alive?) about the properties of 60
                  different nouns prompted by simultaneous
                  presentation of a pictured item and its written
                  name. Our results show that the neural activity
                  observed with \{MEG\} encodes a variety of
                  perceptual and semantic features of stimuli at
                  different times relative to stimulus onset, and in
                  different cortical locations. By decoding these
                  features, our MEG-based classifier was able to
                  reliably distinguish between two different concrete
                  nouns that it had never seen before. The results
                  demonstrate that there are clear differences between
                  the time course of the magnitude of \{MEG\} activity
                  and that of decodable semantic
                  information. Perceptual features were decoded from
                  \{MEG\} activity earlier in time than semantic
                  features, and features related to animacy, size, and
                  manipulability were decoded consistently across
                  subjects. We also observed that regions commonly
                  associated with semantic processing in the fMRI
                  literature may not show high decoding results in
                  MEG. We believe that this type of approach and the
                  accompanying machine learning methods can form the
                  basis for further modeling of the flow of neural
                  information during language processing and a variety
                  of other cognitive processes. "
