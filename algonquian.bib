                  of Ojibwe, this article describes an array of
                  morphological and syntactic constructions used to
                  express identity, equation, existence, possession,
                  location, and focus. Identity constructions with the
                  verb asawi 'be an X' are shown to consistently place
                  their predicate nominal before the verb, suggesting
                  that this position is particularly associated with
                  indefiniteness. By contrast, expressions of
                  equation, which typically have definite predicate
                  nominals, show more variability in the positioning
                  of the predicate nominal. Denominal verbs of
                  identity are also examined, focusing on those which
                  have pronominals as bases. Several distinct sets of
                  verbs of existence are presented, particularly the
                  verb ayaas, which has a variety of functions,
                  expressing identity, existence, and possession, and
                  serving as a diluted base for a host of preverbs
                  expressing various psychological and physical
                  states. Various verbless constructions related to
                  identity and focus are also examined, particularly
                  those involving the ubiquitous predicative particle
                  mii.},
