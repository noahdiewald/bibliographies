	abstract = {The English NPN construction, exemplified by
                  construction after construction, is productive with
                  five prepositions--by, for, to, after, and
                  upon--with a variety of meanings, including
                  succession, juxtaposition, and comparison; it also
                  has numerous idiomatic cases. This mixture of
                  regularity and idiosyncrasy lends itself to an
                  account in the spirit of construction grammar, in
                  which the lexicon includes specified syntactic
                  structures matched with meanings. The internal
                  syntactic structure of NPN violates standard
                  principles of phrase structure, and the required
                  identity of the two nouns (in most cases) presents
                  descriptive difficulties. Furthermore, when NPN
                  appears in NP positions, it can take normal NP
                  complements and modifiers, and it has
                  quantificational semantics despite the absence of a
                  lexical quantifier. These peculiarities collectively
                  present interesting challenges to linguistic
                  theory. The best hope lies in a theory of grammar
                  that (i) recognizes meaningful constructions as
                  theoretical entities; (ii) recognizes a continuum of
                  regularity between words and rules; and (iii)
                  recognizes the autonomy of syntax from semantics and
                  vice versa.},
