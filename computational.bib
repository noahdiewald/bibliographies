	abstract = "In this paper a kernel method for shape recognition
                  is proposed. The approach is based on the edit
                  distance between pairs of shapes after transforming
                  them into symbol strings. The transformation of
                  shapes into symbol strings is invariant to
                  similarity transforms and can handle partial
                  occlusions. Representation of shape contours uses
                  the shape contexts and applies dynamic programming
                  for finding the correspondence between points over
                  shape contours. Corresponding points are then
                  transformed into symbolic representation and the
                  normalized edit distance computes the dissimilarity
                  between pairs of strings in the database. Obtained
                  distances are then transformed into suitable kernels
                  which are classified using support vector
                  machines. Experimental results over a variety of
                  shape databases show that the proposed approach is
                  suitable for shape recognition. "

@article{lodhi2002string-kernels,
	Abstract = {We propose a novel approach for categorizing text
                  documents based on the use of a special kernel. The
                  kernel is an inner product in the feature space
                  generated by all subsequences of length k. A
                  subsequence is any ordered sequence of k characters
                  occurring in the text though not necessarily
                  contiguously. The subsequences are weighted by an
                  exponentially decaying factor of their full length
                  in the text, hence emphasising those occurrences
                  that are close to contiguous. A direct computation
                  of this feature vector would involve a prohibitive
                  amount of computation even for modest values of k,
                  since the dimension of the feature space grows
                  exponentially with k. The paper describes how
                  despite this fact the inner product can be
                  efficiently evaluated by a dynamic programming
                  technique. Experimental comparisons of the
                  performance of the kernel compared with a standard
                  word feature space kernel (Joachims, 1998) show
                  positive results on modestly sized datasets. The
                  case of contiguous subsequence},
