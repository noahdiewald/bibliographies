  abstract     = {In this paper a kernel method for shape recognition
                  is proposed. The approach is based on the edit
                  distance between pairs of shapes after transforming
                  them into symbol strings. The transformation of
                  shapes into symbol strings is invariant to
                  similarity transforms and can handle partial
                  occlusions. Representation of shape contours uses
                  the shape contexts and applies dynamic programming
                  for finding the correspondence between points over
                  shape contours. Corresponding points are then
                  transformed into symbolic representation and the
                  normalized edit distance computes the dissimilarity
                  between pairs of strings in the database. Obtained
                  distances are then transformed into suitable kernels
                  which are classified using support vector
                  machines. Experimental results over a variety of
                  shape databases show that the proposed approach is
                  suitable for shape recognition.},

  abstract     = {We propose a novel approach for categorizing text
                  documents based on the use of a special kernel. The
                  kernel is an inner product in the feature space
                  generated by all subsequences of length k. A
                  subsequence is any ordered sequence of k characters
                  occurring in the text though not necessarily
                  contiguously. The subsequences are weighted by an
                  exponentially decaying factor of their full length
                  in the text, hence emphasising those occurrences
                  that are close to contiguous. A direct computation
                  of this feature vector would involve a prohibitive
                  amount of computation even for modest values of k,
                  since the dimension of the feature space grows
                  exponentially with k. The paper describes how
                  despite this fact the inner product can be
                  efficiently evaluated by a dynamic programming
                  technique. Experimental comparisons of the
                  performance of the kernel compared with a standard
                  word feature space kernel (Joachims, 1998) show
                  positive results on modestly sized datasets. The

  abstract     = {Previous research suggests that the processing of
                  agreement is affected by the distance between the
                  agreeing elements. However, the unique contribution
                  of structural distance (number of intervening
                  syntactic phrases) to the processing of agreement
                  remains an open question, since previous
                  investigations do not tease apart structural and
                  linear distance (number of intervening words). We
                  used event-related potentials (ERPs) to examine the
                  extent to which structural distance impacts the
                  processing of Spanish number and gender
                  agreement. Violations were realized both within the
                  phrase and across the phrase. Across both levels of
                  structural distance, linear distance was kept
                  constant, as was the syntactic category of the
                  agreeing elements. Number and gender agreement
                  violations elicited a robust \{P600\} between 400
                  and 900ms, a component associated with
                  morphosyntactic processing. No amplitude differences
                  were observed between number and gender violations,
                  suggesting that the two features are processed
                  similarly at the brain level. Within-phrase
                  agreement yielded more positive waveforms than
                  across-phrase agreement, both for agreement
                  violations and for grammatical sentences (no
                  agreement by distance interaction). These effects
                  can be interpreted as evidence that structural
                  distance impacts the establishment of agreement
                  overall, consistent with sentence processing models
                  which predict that hierarchical structure impacts
                  the processing of syntactic dependencies. However,
                  due to the lack of an agreement by distance
                  interaction, the possibility cannot be ruled out
                  that these effects are driven by differences in
                  syntactic predictability between the within-phrase
                  and across-phrase configurations, notably the fact
                  that the syntactic category of the critical word was
                  more predictable in the within-phrase conditions.},

  abstract     = {This study explored lexical-syntactic information – syntactic
                  information that is stored in the lexicon – and its
                  relation to syntactic and lexical impairments in
                  aphasia. We focused on two types of
                  lexical-syntactic information: predicate argument
                  structure (PAS) of verbs (the number and types of
                  arguments the verb selects) and grammatical gender
                  of nouns. The participants were 17 Hebrew-speaking
                  individuals with aphasia who had a syntactic deficit
                  (agrammatism) or a lexical retrieval deficit
                  (anomia) located at the semantic lexicon, the
                  phonological output lexicon, or the phonological
                  output buffer. After testing the participants’
                  syntactic and lexical retrieval abilities and
                  establishing the functional loci of their deficits,
                  we assessed their \{PAS\} and grammatical gender
                  knowledge. This assessment included sentence
                  completion, sentence production, sentence
                  repetition, and grammaticality judgment tasks. The
                  participants’ performance on these tests yielded
                  several important dissociations. Three agrammatic
                  participants had impaired syntax but unimpaired
                  \{PAS\} knowledge. Three agrammatic participants had
                  impaired syntax but unimpaired grammatical gender
                  knowledge. This indicates that lexical-syntactic
                  information is represented separately from syntax,
                  and can be spared even when syntax at the sentence
                  level, such as embedding and movement are
                  impaired. All 5 individuals with phonological output
                  buffer impairment and all 3 individuals with
                  phonological output lexicon impairment had preserved
                  lexical-syntactic knowledge. These selective
                  impairments indicate that lexical-syntactic
                  information is represented at a lexical stage prior
                  to the phonological lexicon and the phonological
                  buffer. Three participants with impaired \{PAS\}
                  (aPASia) and impaired grammatical gender who showed
                  intact lexical-semantic knowledge indicate that the
                  lexical-syntactic information is represented
                  separately from the semantic lexicon. This led us to
                  conclude that lexical-syntactic information is
                  stored in a separate syntactic lexicon. A double
                  dissociation between \{PAS\} and grammatical gender
                  impairments indicated that different types of
                  lexical-syntactic information are represented
                  separately in this syntactic lexicon.},

  abstract     = {Summary Humans can see and name thousands of
                  distinct object and action categories, so it is
                  unlikely that each category is represented in a
                  distinct brain area. A more efficient scheme would
                  be to represent categories as locations in a
                  continuous semantic space mapped smoothly across the
                  cortical surface. To search for such a space, we
                  used fMRI to measure human brain activity evoked by
                  natural movies. We then used voxelwise models to
                  examine the cortical representation of 1,705 object
                  and action categories. The first few dimensions of
                  the underlying semantic space were recovered from
                  the fit models by principal components
                  analysis. Projection of the recovered semantic space
                  onto cortical flat maps shows that semantic
                  selectivity is organized into smooth gradients that
                  cover much of visual and nonvisual
                  cortex. Furthermore, both the recovered semantic
                  space and the cortical organization of the space are
                  shared across different individuals. Video Abstract},

  abstract     = {Syntactic relationships among non-adjacent words are
                  a core aspect of sentence structure. Research on
                  complex sentences with displaced elements has
                  concluded that resolving long-distance dependencies
                  can tax working memory. Here we examine a simpler
                  relationship—morphological agreement between the
                  elements of a noun phrase—across a gradient of
                  distance. Participants read sentences with
                  violations of gender agreement among Spanish nouns,
                  determiners and adjectives. For those explicitly
                  assigned the task of detecting errors, accuracy was
                  uniformly high across the four levels of distance
                  between (dis)agreeing words. A second group
                  performed a comprehension task as \{ERPs\} were
                  recorded. Gender agreement errors elicited a left
                  anterior negativity (LAN) regardless of the distance
                  between (dis)agreeing words, indicating that the
                  errors were detected. In contrast, a temporally
                  later component of the \{ERP\} (P600) showed
                  decreasing amplitudes as the number of words between
                  (dis)agreeing elements increased. Smaller \{P600\}
                  responses were also associated with slower responses
                  to the comprehension questions. Given other work
                  suggesting that the \{P600\} indexes attempted
                  repair of a problematic sentence structure, the
                  results suggest that the participants became
                  increasingly unwilling to re-visit their initial
                  parse of a sentence as the required effort
                  increased, despite having noted an error. The
                  results are discussed within the context of studies
                  showing that readers often compute inadequate
                  structural representations of sentences. We suggest
                  that \{P600\} amplitude may reflect the costs versus
                  benefits of sentence re-analysis, determined by a
                  combination of sentence structure, task
                  requirements, and the degree to which sentence
                  meaning hinges on a correct structural analysis.},

                  magnetoencephalography (MEG) and machine learning
                  techniques to investigate the flow of perceptual and
                  semantic information decodable from neural activity
                  in the half second during which the brain
                  comprehends the meaning of a concrete
                  noun. Important information about the cortical
                  location of neural activity related to the
                  representation of nouns in the human brain has been
                  revealed by past studies using fMRI. However, the
                  temporal sequence of processing from sensory input
                  to concept comprehension remains unclear, in part
                  because of the poor time resolution provided by
                  fMRI. In this study, subjects answered 20 questions
                  (e.g. is it alive?) about the properties of 60
                  different nouns prompted by simultaneous
                  presentation of a pictured item and its written
                  name. Our results show that the neural activity
                  observed with \{MEG\} encodes a variety of
                  perceptual and semantic features of stimuli at
                  different times relative to stimulus onset, and in
                  different cortical locations. By decoding these
                  features, our MEG-based classifier was able to
                  reliably distinguish between two different concrete
                  nouns that it had never seen before. The results
                  demonstrate that there are clear differences between
                  the time course of the magnitude of \{MEG\} activity
                  and that of decodable semantic
                  information. Perceptual features were decoded from
                  \{MEG\} activity earlier in time than semantic
                  features, and features related to animacy, size, and
                  manipulability were decoded consistently across
                  subjects. We also observed that regions commonly
                  associated with semantic processing in the fMRI
                  literature may not show high decoding results in
                  MEG. We believe that this type of approach and the
                  accompanying machine learning methods can form the
                  basis for further modeling of the flow of neural
                  information during language processing and a variety
                  of other cognitive processes.},

                  of Ojibwe, this article describes an array of
                  morphological and syntactic constructions used to
                  express identity, equation, existence, possession,
                  location, and focus. Identity constructions with the
                  verb asawi 'be an X' are shown to consistently place
                  their predicate nominal before the verb, suggesting
                  that this position is particularly associated with
                  indefiniteness. By contrast, expressions of
                  equation, which typically have definite predicate
                  nominals, show more variability in the positioning
                  of the predicate nominal. Denominal verbs of
                  identity are also examined, focusing on those which
                  have pronominals as bases. Several distinct sets of
                  verbs of existence are presented, particularly the
                  verb ayaas, which has a variety of functions,
                  expressing identity, existence, and possession, and
                  serving as a diluted base for a host of preverbs
                  expressing various psychological and physical
                  states. Various verbless constructions related to
                  identity and focus are also examined, particularly
                  those involving the ubiquitous predicative particle
                  mii.},

  abstract            = {The English NPN construction, exemplified by
                  construction after construction, is productive with
                  five prepositions--by, for, to, after, and
                  upon--with a variety of meanings, including
                  succession, juxtaposition, and comparison; it also
                  has numerous idiomatic cases. This mixture of
                  regularity and idiosyncrasy lends itself to an
                  account in the spirit of construction grammar, in
                  which the lexicon includes specified syntactic
                  structures matched with meanings. The internal
                  syntactic structure of NPN violates standard
                  principles of phrase structure, and the required
                  identity of the two nouns (in most cases) presents
                  descriptive difficulties. Furthermore, when NPN
                  appears in NP positions, it can take normal NP
                  complements and modifiers, and it has
                  quantificational semantics despite the absence of a
                  lexical quantifier. These peculiarities collectively
                  present interesting challenges to linguistic
                  theory. The best hope lies in a theory of grammar
                  that (i) recognizes meaningful constructions as
                  theoretical entities; (ii) recognizes a continuum of
                  regularity between words and rules; and (iii)
                  recognizes the autonomy of syntax from semantics and
                  vice versa.},

We investigate three constraints, (i) the preference for the presence of an overt NP antecedent that is not part of another word, (ii) the salience of the position of an antecedent that is part of another word, and (iii) the uniqueness of an intended antecedent (in terms of world knowledge). We compare constructions in which intended antecedents occur in a context such as who owns an N / who is an N-owner with constructions of the type who was without an N / who was N-less . Our findings corroborate the existence of the overt NP antecedent constraint, and also show that the salience of an unsuitable antecedent’s position matters. Furthermore, our findings show that uniqueness only matters in the N-less type construction and not in the N-owner type construction; we conclude that this supports a potential approach in terms of dynamic semantics over a competing e-type approach.},

There is considerably less agreement regarding the precise cognitive mechanisms that underlie these interactive effects. For example, are they driven by purely production-internal mechanisms (e.g., Dell, 1986) or do they reflect the influence of perceptual monitoring mechanisms on production processes (e.g., Roelofs, 2004)? Acoustic analyses reveal the phonetic realisation of words is influenced by their word-specific properties – supporting the presence of interaction between lexical-level and phonetic information in speech production. A second experiment examines what mechanisms are responsible for this interactive effect. The results suggest the effect occurs on-line and is not purely driven by listener modelling. These findings are consistent with the presence of an interactive mechanism that is online and internal to the production system.},

To what extent is this done automatically and egocentrically, because it is easiest for speakers themselves, and to what extent is it driven by the informational needs of addressees? In 20 triads of naive subjects, speakers told the same Road Runner cartoon story twice to one addressee and once to another addressee, counterbalanced for order (Addressee1/Addressee1/Addressee2 or Addressee1/Addressee2/Addressee1). Stories retold to the same (old)
addressees were attenuated compared to those retold to new addressees; this was true for events mentioned, number of words, and amount of detail. Moreover, lexically identical expressions by the same speaker were more intelligible to another group of listeners when the expressions had been addressed to new addressees than when they had been addressed to old addressees. We conclude that speakers’ attenuating of information in spontaneous discourse is driven at least in part by addressees. Such audience design is computationally feasible when it can be guided by a ‘‘one-bit” model (my audience has heard this before, or not).},

The design of the HCRC Map Task enables us to do so. We examine two ‘tailoring’ changes in repeated mentions of landmark names: faster articulation and simplified referring expressions. Articulation results replicate Bard et al. (2000) depending only on what the speaker has heard. Change between mentions was no greater when it could be inferred that the listener could see the named item (Expt 1) and no less when the listener explicitly denied ability to do so (Expt 2). Word duration fell for speaker-given listener-new items (Expt 3). Reduction was unaffected by the repeater’s ability to see the mentioned landmark (Expt 4). In contrast, referential form was more sensitive to both listener- (Expt 3) and speaker-knowledge (Expt 4). The results conform most closely to a Dual Process model: fast, automatic, processes let the speaker-knowledge prime word articulation, while costly assessments of listener-knowledge influence only referential form.},

Historical accounts appeal in addition to the recency and frequency of past references and to partner-specific conceptualizations of the object that people achieve interactively. Evidence from 3 experiments favors a historical account and suggests that when speakers refer to an object, they are proposing a conceptualization of it, a proposal their addresses may or may not agree to. Once they do establish a shared conceptualization, a conceptual pact, they appeal to it in later references even when they could use simpler references.

  abstract     = {MacDonald (2013) proposes that comprehenders are sensitive to statistical patterns in their language input (Claim 1). These patterns are hypothesized to result from speakers' preferences in production, aggregated over the population (Claim 2). Production preferences are taken to be primarily determined by biases that serve production ease, thereby improving fluency (Claim 3). These three claims, together constituting the core of the PDC, are an ambitious endeavor to tie together several lines of research in psycholinguistics and linguistics. Here, I focus on the second and third claim, that it is predominantly “production ease,” rather than communicative pressures, that drives production preferences and hence language form (M, p. 13; cf. Bard et al., 2000; Ferreira and Dell, 2000; Arnold, 2008; Ferreira, 2008; Lam and Watson, 2010).

In contrast, I argue that production preferences and language form are unlikely to be understood without reference to communication. Specifically, production preferences are the result of at least two competing type of biases: biases toward production ease and biases toward ease, or at least success, of comprehension (Zipf, 1949). I refer to a weak version of the second type of bias as robust information transfer.1 Two hypotheses about how robust information transfer might affect production preferences are often conflated in the literature. First, speakers might continuously “estimate” their interlocutors' beliefs and structure their utterances based on these estimates. This claim, often referred to as audience design, is what production researchers (incl. M) tend to have in mind when they reject the idea that production preferences are affected by communicative biases. Many consider this claim implausible because production seems too demanding to allow additional computations (Ferreira, 2008). I share Tanenhaus's position that such intuitions are often misleading (Tanenhaus, 2013). Here, however, I pursue an alternative hypothesis, that communicative biases affect production preferences through learning and generalization across previous experiences (building on Jaeger and Ferreira, in press).},

In order to investigate the mental processes that underlie such perspective taking, we tracked people's eye movements while they were following instructions to manipulate objects. The eye fixation data in two experiments demonstrate that people do not restrict the search for referents to mutually known objects. Eye movements indicated that addressees considered objects as potential referents even when the speaker could not see those objects, requiring addressees to use mutual knowledge to correct their interpretation. Thus, people occasionally use an egocentric heuristic when they comprehend. We argue that this egocentric heuristic is successful in reducing ambiguity, though it could lead to a systematic error.},

A relationship between individual variation in theory of mind and phonetic reduction was observed only for semantic predictability, and in the direction opposite to that predicted by listener-oriented theories.

Recent work has suggested that predictability effects result from hardwired properties of the language production system, rather than active modulation by the talker to accommodate the listener. However, these studies investigated only minor manipulations of listener characteristics. Here, we examine predictability effects with two very different listener populations: adults and preverbal infants. Using mixed effects regressions on spontaneous speech corpora, we compare the effect of word frequency, probability in context, and previous mention on word duration in adult-directed and infant-directed speech. We find that the effects of preceding context and word frequency differ according to listener. Contrary to previous work, these results suggest that talkers do modulate the phonetic effects of predictability based on listener characteristics. To our knowledge, this study is also the first published analysis of predictability effects in infant-directed speech.},

This study shows that speakers set spatial perspectives differently with actual conversational partners than with the usually studied imaginary addressees. Speakers with partners tended to use more egocentric perspectives than solo speakers. Pairs varied idiosyncratically in the perspective-setting strategies they picked, but all engaged in the same collaborative process: talking until both were sure they had understood each other. When conversational roles switched, the new speakers allocated spatial perspectives with remarkable precision, taking their partners' perspectives just as often as the partner had taken theirs. Speakers were more explicit about whose perspective they were taking when they held the floor for only one description than when they gave many descriptions in a row.},

Kirov and Cotterell (2018) argue that the answer is yes: modern Encoder-Decoder (ED) architectures learn human-like behavior when inflecting English verbs, such as extending the regular past tense form /-(e)d/ to novel words. However, their work does not address the criticism raised by Marcus et al. (1995): that neural models may learn to extend not the regular, but the most frequent class — and thus fail on tasks like German number inflection, where infrequent suffixes like /-s/ can still be productively generalized. To investigate this question, we first collect a new dataset from German speakers (production and ratings of plural forms for novel nouns) that is designed to avoid sources of information unavailable to the ED model. The speaker data show high variability, and two suffixes evince ‘regular’ behavior, appearing more often with phonologically atypical inputs. Encoder-decoder models do generalize the most frequently produced plural class, but do not show human-like variability or ‘regular’ extension of these other plural markers. We conclude that modern neural models may still struggle with minority-class generalization.},

More specifically, it investigates whether the sense network that emerges from the principled polysemy model of over as proposed by Tyler & Evans (2003; 2001) can be reconstructed by the neural language model BERT. The study assesses whether the contextual information encoded in BERT embeddings can be employed to succesfully (i) recognize the abstract sense categories and (ii) replicate the relative distances between the senses of over proposed in the principled polysemy model. The results suggest that, while there is partial convergence, the two models ultimately lead to different global abstractions because the imagistic information that plays a key role in conceptual approaches to prepositional meaning may not be encoded in contextualized word embeddings.},

Previous research detected language-specific preferences in pronoun resolution in utterances of the type “The postman met the streetsweeper before he went home”. These preferences have been attributed to the interaction of information structural and syntactic constraints inducing a subject bias on the one hand, and Gricean reasoning processes taking into account alternative syntactic constructions on the other hand. A corpus study of four English and French corpora shows that an alternative construction which takes a subject antecedent (“The postman met the streetsweeper before going home”) is much less frequent in spoken English than French. A Rational Speech Act (RSA) model with corpus frequencies integrated as language-specific costs on the use of each construction makes empirical predictions for pronoun resolution preferences in French and English for sentences with “avant”/“before” which have been tested before but also for sentences with “après”/“after” which have not been tested so far. New experimental data show a very good fit of the model predictions for pronoun resolution preferences in English as well as for the differences in antecedent choices between French and English. However, experimental data showing differences in antecedent choices between French sentences with “après” and “avant” deviate from model predictions, indicating that more factors need to be taken into account. The combination of Bayesian modeling, corpus analyses and experimental data shows that RSA models can make relevant and falsifiable predictions for cross-linguistic variation in processing.},
